The Unified Logging WordPress plugin enables php logging information to be sent to Unified Logging

== Description ==

Unified Logging is Logging as a Service (LaaS).  This plugin taps into php logging and sends the logging information to Unified Logging (http://www.unifiedlogging.com) so you can be notified if something goes wrong and then can review the messages.

Your data is sent over ssl and the secret key is used to create a hash to make sure the data is not tampered with.

NOTE: this plugin may work with earlier versions but has not been tested.
